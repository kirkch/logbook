RIVER
-----

River is a RESTful http server.  An elastic, scalable and robust computational
grid that supports fast GET requests, background asynchrounous updates,
transactionally safe updates and messaging, and grid wide map/reduce queries.
Real time operational and business metric monitoring is built in from the start.
 River was designed to be as happy running on a single server, a private
data centre or a virtualised cloud such as Amazon.
